1. source ~/.profile
2. ls -l /opt/spark
3. start-master.sh 
4. stop-master.sh (to stop the earlier sessions)
5. start-master.sh (to start the new session)
6. spark-shell


7.1 (Now spark logo appears and you are in scala terminal if you get (scala> ))
7.2 (create a text file in the spark folder)
7.3 var lines = sc.textFile("input1.txt")

8. var words = lines.flatMap(_.split(" "))
flatMap function is used in order to split the words by spaces in between
if split(" ") not mentioned then it splits by individual letters

9. var wordsfreq = words.map((_, 1))
countng the words and every word even though repeated gets frequency as 1

10. var wordCounts = wordsfreq.reduceByKey(_ + _ )
every repeated word ko merge karke single cnt dena

11. wordCounts.saveAsTextFile("myopt")
save the ouput of wordcount in new directory

12.  wordCounts.foreach(println)
print the output
